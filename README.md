# A summary for the article
## good developers mindset
It is a very useful artical for *developers* because it mentioned many impotant points that *developers* shoud be aware to . Here I'm gonig to mention some of them:
- simplicity: a good developer creates things that are easy to understand so that itâ€™s really easy to shake out all the bugs.
- testing: a good way to detect errors.
- resistance : always resist adding more code, more features until you are convinced that they are required 

and here I'm going to add a link for the **complete article** for more information
